# ApplianceController
The task is to design and implement frontend and backend services to manage appliances such as a wash machine or an oven. 

## Stack
MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node), Redux, Redux-Thunk, CSS, Chai, Mocha, Enzyme

## Requirements
* We expect to see CRUD operations for appliances and receiving commands on backend side. 
* The state of appliance must contain a minimum set of fields (please design the data model yourself). 
* We expect to see REST or GraphQL API. 
* Information and state of the all appliances should be persisted to any form of persistent storage. 
* We also expect to see information of all appliances, possibility of creating, editing, deleting appliance and sending commands on UI side.
* The backend service should be implemented using Node.js. 
* Unit tests are expected and the assignment will be assessed based on good programming practices and design.
* The frontend service should be implemented using React at the core. 
* UI tests are also expected. 
* There are no requirements related to amount and structure of UI pages, CSS styling, e.t.c.
